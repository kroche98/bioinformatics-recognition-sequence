# Enzyme Restriction Site Finder

This was submitted as the second project for the Bioinformatics Programming course I took in the Spring 2019 semester.

Given a DNA strand, it determines all the enzymes with at least one restriction site matching part of the DNA strand.

The data on restriction sequences comes from the link_allenz.txt file, and the matching is all done using regular expressions.
